}
\description{
This models are described in Bartomeus at al. (2015 Functional Ecology) and are based
on Williams et al. 2000 models. They are intended to be used with fit_it function. The integrated model
considers both neutral and niche constrains, while the neutral and niche models only consider its respective
components.
