A) Conceptual representation of a trait-matching constraint. Interactions (in black) are observed only when both species have traits that are compatible. B) Representation of the density function for available body size in the Barnes et al. (2008) dataset, the trait-matching function (red line) and the observed distribution of prey size for a given predator (black lines). C) Representation of the observed interactions (black dots) and the maximum likelihood estimate of the trait-matching function (from low probability in yellow to high probability in red). }}{3}}
